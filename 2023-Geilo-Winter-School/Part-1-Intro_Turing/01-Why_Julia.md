# Why Julia?

> "runs like C but reads like Python", meaning that is blazing fast, easy to prototype and read/write code

1. Speed
1. Multiple Dispatch
1. Ease of use
1. Very good built-in Pkg manager

## Speed

## Ease of Use

1. The "two-language" problem

## Multiple Dispatch

A generalization of single-dispatch polymorphism,
"multiple dispatch is a feature that allows a function or method to be dynamically dispatched based on the run-time (dynamic) type or, in the more general case, some other attribute of more than one of its arguments."

## Oh another thing...

If you need to code something new in R and Python, in order to be fast you'll need to do it in C++ also.
In Julia you can do 100% Julia and it will be faster from the get-go.
