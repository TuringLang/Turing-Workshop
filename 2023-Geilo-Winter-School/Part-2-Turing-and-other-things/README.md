#  Geilo Winter School 2023 (Part 2): Bayesian inference and other things with the `TuringLang` ecosystem

Here you find the presentation in several different formats:
- `notes.jl`: Julia file which you can just step through and execute. Nice if you're in VS Code.
- `notes.md`: A markdown file which comes with more context than the Julia file, easily readable in Github itself.
- `notes.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook version of the markdown file.
- `notes.org`: A Org-mode file, which is the source of all the files above and probably the easiest to read on Github, _but_ not supported by most editors (unless you're using Emacs).

Pick your poison, and follow along!
