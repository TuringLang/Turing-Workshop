This talk is prepared for the [Method Week](https://learnbayes.se/events/bayes-in-julia-with-turing-jl/) in Karolinska Institutet. It is a part of their _Learn Bayes Spring Program 2025_.

The model used in the talk is initially provided by Simon Steiger (one of the main organizers of the Method Week), but transformed into generative form by Xianda Sun.

The code accompanying the talk is `code.jl` and `utils.jl`. Both are copied to `code.ipynb` for convenience.

`plots.jl` is used to generate the plots in the talk.
